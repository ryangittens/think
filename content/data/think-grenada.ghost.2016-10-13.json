Part one.","slug":"the-lingering-effects-of-colonialism-and-slavery","markdown":"As citizens of the tri-island state of Grenada it can be argued that most of our traditional norms and practices are directly derived from our colonial encounters. We can examine this from a number  of the areas. Firstly:\n\nRELIGION - Grenada is a state, where most people follow many religious philosophies, predominantly Christianity. Looking at this philosophy pragmaticly, one can realize that as a people we adopted this particular religious ideology in the period of slavery. And as harsh/unrealistic as this may sound and through very cruel processes, we were coerced to accept this ideology. Many people today in our \"Christian\" society neglect these realities, to console themselves into thinking that the Christian religion is our \"true religion\"; nothing is further from\nThe truth! As people of African descent, which for some Grenadian's they don't accept being called Africans because for some reason they interpet they their geo-political\nplace with their race. Thus, they prefer to be called grenadians. In this shocking revelation, one can see how regressive the effects of colonialism and slavery has left our society. In that aspect we deny our own identity, for an artificial state name, given by the people who brought us here in the first place. Some persons argue that Caribbean nationalistic ideologies are nothing but politically correct names for being a slave in modern day. There are no ethnographical evidence to support these artificial states, the customs and practices are not original practices of the people. These are false-consciousness adopted by a people from their master after being subjected (and in some cases are still undergo) to inhumane treatment for centuries.\nSimilarly there are other religious ideologies that are steadily taken hold, such as Islam, Mormonism and other various sects of Christianity, what is striking to note is the direct correlation between fundamentally religious societies and poverty a 2010 Gallup poll suggests. An independent study by Dr.Tom Rees, published in the journal of religion and society, suggests that in places without strong social safety nets to\nProvide people with opportunities for upward mobility, people are more likely to rely on religion for comfort. Both the poll and the study highlighted correlations between religion and poverty. So how then, do we get ourselves as a people out of this hole? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Photo Credit: https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=images&cd=&ved=0ahUKEwibpZjLuqDOAhWNsB4KHd6eB6EQjB0IBg&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.slayerment.com%2Fwhites-ended-slavery&psig=AFQjCNGiUiMWQlpJnNRRpVTO4PleG8DvjQ&ust=1470148876262308&rct=j","mobiledoc":null,"html":"<p>As citizens of the tri-island state of Grenada it can be argued that most of our traditional norms and practices are directly derived from our colonial encounters. We can examine this from a number  of the areas. Firstly:</p>\n\n<p>RELIGION - Grenada is a state, where most people follow many religious philosophies, predominantly Christianity. Looking at this philosophy pragmaticly, one can realize that as a people we adopted this particular religious ideology in the period of slavery. And as harsh/unrealistic as this may sound and through very cruel processes, we were coerced to accept this ideology. Many people today in our \"Christian\" society neglect these realities, to console themselves into thinking that the Christian religion is our \"true religion\"; nothing is further from <br />\nThe truth! As people of African descent, which for some Grenadian's they don't accept being called Africans because for some reason they interpet they their geo-political <br />\nplace with their race. Thus, they prefer to be called grenadians. In this shocking revelation, one can see how regressive the effects of colonialism and slavery has left our society. In that aspect we deny our own identity, for an artificial state name, given by the people who brought us here in the first place. Some persons argue that Caribbean nationalistic ideologies are nothing but politically correct names for being a slave in modern day. There are no ethnographical evidence to support these artificial states, the customs and practices are not original practices of the people. These are false-consciousness adopted by a people from their master after being subjected (and in some cases are still undergo) to inhumane treatment for centuries. <br />\nSimilarly there are other religious ideologies that are steadily taken hold, such as Islam, Mormonism and other various sects of Christianity, what is striking to note is the direct correlation between fundamentally religious societies and poverty a 2010 Gallup poll suggests. An independent study by Dr.Tom Rees, published in the journal of religion and society, suggests that in places without strong social safety nets to <br />\nProvide people with opportunities for upward mobility, people are more likely to rely on religion for comfort. Both the poll and the study highlighted correlations between religion and poverty. So how then, do we get ourselves as a people out of this hole? </p>\n\n<p>Photo Credit: <a
